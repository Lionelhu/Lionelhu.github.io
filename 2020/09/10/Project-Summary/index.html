            <h2 id="Gender-Differences-in-Depression-and-Sleep-A-Network-Analysis"><a href="#Gender-Differences-in-Depression-and-Sleep-A-Network-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Gender Differences in Depression and Sleep: A Network Analysis"></a><center>Gender Differences in Depression and Sleep: A Network Analysis</center></h2><p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)- a common, prevalent, and chronic mental disorder- affects more than 300-million people worldwide. Being one of most debilitating conditions worldwide, depression is considered as one of the most dangerous and vicious mental disorders. Accordingly, research identifying the mechanisms underlying depression, which may shed light on future development of strategy in combating this notorious condition, is more and more pressing and desperately desired. Nowadays, the fast-pace society deprives people from having high-quality sleep. Though the damages caused by lack of sleep have not yet been thoroughly clarified, sleep deficiency is, in lay opinions, frequently regarded as one of the major sources of modern mental problems. It thus becomes natural that a hypothesis concerning the interactive relationship between depression and sleep to be established. Furthermore, gender differences are also taken into careful evaluation, considering the significant gender differences in depression. This research intended to use network analysis model comparison to identify the gender differences in sleep and depression point by point, aiming to reach a possible conclusion validated by multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>In this study, a total of 4,981 participants (1,293 females) from National Railway Administration of People’s Republic of China were recruited to complete measures of depression and sleep. The range of age in this sample is – (M = 32.434, SD =9.080). The intention underlying the sampling is to explicitly illustrate the relationship between sleep and depression through a typical group of participants that may experience sleep disturbance. Referring to the measurement of sleep-related variables, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is deployed in this research. The PSQI is a standardized scale evaluating sleep quality in the past month from multiple aspects. Meanwhile, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) is applied to measure the severity of depression and elevation in individual symptoms. The CESD was created in 1977 by Laurie Radloff, and revised in 2004 by William Eaton and others. The CESD has become one of the most widely-used depression scale since its first use in the Community Mental Health Assessment Surveys in the 1970’s and it remains its renown in epidemiologic studies of depression, thanks to its specialization. Obviously, this research used questionnaire survey as the major method in collecting data.</p>
<p>During the course of data analysis, several conclusions were reached by applying graphical lasso (glasso) network estimations. Figure 1 demonstrates the relationship between different variables through glasso network. Groups of strong inter-correlation split the 27 variables into 4 groups of symptoms. Although the internal connections within these groups were seemingly strong, these positive correlations were very likely to be just parallel symptoms. The network graph also showed that items of depression and sleep tends to gather separately. In other words, there aren’t many robust connections across diagnosis. Although daily functioning is closely linked to behaviors that are characteristic of depression (i.e., crying), the link itself is neither clinically meaningful nor informative for future research.</p>
<p>Next, we decided to explore potential gender differences in the depression-sleep network. The result showed that around 39.5% of the edges demonstrated strong connection. Female model (Figure2) suggests that female participants have more nodes that are involved in groups, forming a dispersive distribution while male participants have significant group divisions and central nodes. Male subjects (Figure3) presented a network much more similar to the overall one. This may result from the sample composition, for male participants are almost twice as many as female participants. The respective network analysis doesn’t provide valuable clues which inspired us to further use network comparison. Fortunately, network comparison breaks the previous predicament. The comparison suggested that males are more likely to suffer from the negative effect of depression and sleep when compared (Figure4). In addition, centrality plots were applied in males and females, separately, to demonstrate the strength, betweenness, and expected influence of different variables. Although strength and expected influence centralities were similar across genders, the difference in the betweenness centrality is significant. Specifically speaking, the two gender had relatively intense differentiation in depression15 “People are unfriendly” and depression17 “I had crying spell”. (Figure5). Besides, the comparison further validated the conclusion reached in respective analysis: in female participants, manifested multiple centrality while men participants demonstrates a single centrality of depression 17(I had crying spells). This means that females are more likely to encounter negative effects resulted from depression and sleep jointly. For the male side, a single peak is readily perceived in the result: depression17 (I had crying spells) showed its strong inter-connectivity than any other node. We accordingly reckon Crying as a characteristic that can</p>
<p>be used to distinguish depressed participants from their non-depressed counterparts, but only in males.</p>
<p>Through the network comparison analysis, several conclusions had been reached. Firstly, direct relationship between sleep and depression exists. Secondly, females have greater propensity to simultaneously suffer from negative impact brought by sleep disorder and depression when compared with men. The result of the research also triggers inspiration. Though no significant link between sleep and depression had been found, it still demonstrated the great potential of connecting sleep with mental disorders. Furthermore, the research also implies the impact gender difference can make on the gender difference in psychology. Nonetheless, the research is also limited by its drawbacks. The cause-and-effect relationship wasn’t well illustrated and taken into consideration in the research, which makes the identification of the casualty hardly possible. The drawback is to remind future related researches to employ directed network analysis.</p>
